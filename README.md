STM32 Pilot brings multi-rotor support to older generations of RC radios that only have support for fixed-wing and / or helicopters.
It achieves this by mixing the receivers linear signals via an STM32, and then outputs them again to the ESCs of the multi-rotor's motors.

The intention for this project is to be compatible with the signal output of all major brands of RC radios that do not have multi-rotor mixing, and to run on any STM32 Black Pill or Blue Pill board.

At the time of writing, I have only used a Futaba T7C radio and an STM32F401 black pill board.
